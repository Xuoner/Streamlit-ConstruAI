# Chatbot Interface

## Overview

This repository contains a **Streamlit-based interface** I developed for **AmonAI**, a startup specializing in AI-driven solutions. The interface was designed to **demonstrate the company's chatbot to clients**, providing an interactive and user-friendly experience.

**Important:** This is **only the interface**, not the fully functional chatbot. The underlying RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) code was not included, as the focus was on showcasing the interface for presentation purposes.

## Key Features

* **Interactive Chat Interface:** Users can type messages and see simulated chatbot responses.
* **Client-Focused Presentation:** Designed to be visually appealing and easy to use for demonstrations.
* **Streamlit Widgets:** Utilizes buttons, text input fields, and dynamic displays to mimic chat behavior.
* **Customizable Layout:** Supports branding and theming consistent with AmonAI's visual identity.

## Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python
* **Framework:** [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
* **Front-End Components:** Streamlit built-in widgets and layout features
* **Optional Visualization:** Can include charts or messages history display for richer demonstration

## License

This project is for **demonstration purposes** only. The code can be explored for learning or presentation adaptations, but does not contain the functional chatbot backend.
